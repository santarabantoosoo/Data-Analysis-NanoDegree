From the output of `df.info()` you can see that there are 8 non-null values, which leaves 3 null values of the 11 entries. [Missing data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_data) is an issue that should be handled differently depending on several factors, such as the reason those values are missing and whether the occurrences seem random. One way of handling them is [imputing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imputation_(statistics) them with the mean. You can do this quickly and efficiently with a convenient function from Pandas."
